# Autonomous-Sign-following-Bot

Engineered an autonomous car using Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors which can read sign boards using Image Processing techniques and navigate with the help of these signs. Trained a model using TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification of sign board images.

I have attached the Main code (OpenCV and Raspberry Pi code). Tensorflow code is missing.
